    <h1>Features</h1>
    <p2>This port is built using rust programming and this allows the user to scan the port on specific ip address within a timmeline of 5 seconds as i have coded it to use the hyperthraeding feature. This version is a most stable when compared to the conventional 
     port scanners in the industry</p2>
    <h1>Source code </h1>
    <p2>You can view and edit the source code by just downloadloading the main.rs file and import it in IDE and just execute cargo build and also copy the dependencies to the cargo.toml file in order to run the program without any errors.</p2>
    <h1>Custom IP Scanning </h1>
    <p>You can change the IP to your destination ip in the code section, target_ip.</p>
    <h1>How to use </h1>
    <p2>You can just use this program by running this installer and soon I will be releasing an update of getting the ip as input</p2>
