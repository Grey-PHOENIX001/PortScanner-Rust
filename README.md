    <h1>Festures</h1>
    <p2>This port is built using rust programming and this allows the user to scan the port on specific ip address within a timmeline of 5 seconds as i have coded it to use the hyperthraeding feature. This version is a most stable when compared to the conventional port scanners in the industry</p2>
    <h1>How to use </h1>
    <p2>You can just use this program by running this installer and soon i will be releasing an update of getting the ip as input.</p2>
